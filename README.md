# My Dotfiles

My commonly used dotfiles for bash, git, and zsh.

Script loosely based on [Michael Smalley's post](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/).

Setup instructions:

```
git clone https://github.com/thedch/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod 700 make.sh
./make.sh
```
